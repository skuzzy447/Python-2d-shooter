# Simple Top-Down Shooter

WASD - Walk  
Shift - Sprint  
Arrow Keys - Fire Arrow  
Scroll - Zoom


## Todo List

 * Add attack/hit/death animations
 * Add day/night cycle
 * Add UI and menus  
 * Add inventory and drops
 * Fix enemy pathfinding

 ### Known Bugs

 * Enemies do not pathfind to exact player position. I need to learn more about pathfinding algorithms before it can be fixed
